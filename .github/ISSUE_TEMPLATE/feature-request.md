**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
I'm always frustrated when I need to refer to the previous or the next quest but the hyperlink is not provided. So I go back to campaigns or the quests tab and then find the quest I need and again come back to the quest I am working on.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
An ordered hyperlink at the end of each quest that links the webpage to all the quest within its campaign. If the redirected link opens in a new tab that would really be handy. Also the Deliverable tab at the start should always be linked to the last step so that navigating to the start and end becomes easier

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
When a quest has lot of steps or content and the need to switch to a different quest arises I prefer clicking the middle mouse button to open the quests tab from left panel in a new window.

**Additional context**
A dark mode feature is something I am desperately waiting for!!
